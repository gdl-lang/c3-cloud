			use = <"To record data used in determining guideline-based recommendations in managing blood pressure in diabetic patients. Based on responses to questions on the patient's blood pressure status, ancestry, the presence of vascular complications, the clinical response to different medication groups, the presence of side effects of previous antihypertensive medication and others, various recommendations are provided for both normotensive and hypertensive patients (newly-diagnosed or previously diagnosed). The recommendations include treatment options and frequency of follow-up blood pressure checks.
NOTE:
It is mandatory to answer ALL questions. If a question is not yet relevant, answer with 'No'. 
ALL recommendations given must be adhered to. 
Target blood pressure is generally <140/80 mmHg, OR <130/80 mmHg if the patient also has micro-/macrovascular complications.">
