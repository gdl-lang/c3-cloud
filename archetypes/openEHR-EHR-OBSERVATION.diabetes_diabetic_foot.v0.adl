Also to give recommendations for the prevention and general management of diabetic foot problems. Risk stratification and provided recommendations are based on the presence or absence of certain observable clinical findings in children, young people or adults with newly-diagnosed or long-standing diabetes.
The named clinical findings (risk factors) are prefixed with 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 indicating in ascending risk order: low(or no)-risk, moderate-risk, high-risk, active or life-threatening respectively. If a patient has multiple risk factors, the one associated with the highest risk level is selected.">
